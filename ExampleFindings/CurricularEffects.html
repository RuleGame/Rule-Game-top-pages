<h2> Visualizing Curricular Effects </h2>


<p>  </p> 

<p> For human learning (HL)
we have  established a rigorous way to assess the impact of a "curricular experience" on each human player. A "curriculum" is the set of rules that a player has encountered preceding the rule that is being analyzed. Let us call these rules A and B. The  experience depends on whether the player managed to discover one or both of them. We represent this with a lower case letter if the player did not solve it; with the upper case for instances when the player did solve it. We can then study combination of concepts, such as "remove pieces in reading order ( R).  and place them in the nearest bucket (N)" (using Greek letter  θ to represent this "target rule"). We divide the participants so that they encounter all five curricula:<br>
 θ; Rθ;Nθ; RNθ, and NRθ. <br>
 Their experiences before θ may thus be any of <br>
 r,n,R,N,rN,Rn,rn,RN,nr,nR,Nr, NR.<br>
 We then ask: how much does each of these experiences affect the ease of discovering the target rule θ?  Results for this particular compound rule are shown in Figure 1. The x-axis is the number of the move at which a player begins a string of 10 moves without error (called m*.)  The y-axis shows the cumulated fraction of all players whose "aha" for that curricular experience comes at or before a given move; the marked point represents M*, the median value for those players who do solve the rule. Note that the cumulated distribution at this point is half of the fraction (F*) of all players who do solve the rule.  Generally, when a curricular experience makes the rule easier, its representative  point is both above and to the left of the representative point for condition  θ, the target rule with no prior experience.
