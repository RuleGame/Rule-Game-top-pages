<h2> Comparing Machine Learning to Human Learning </h2>


<p> To display crossings visually it is necessary to convert several kinds of data to comparable ratio scale measures. There is considerable arbitrariness in how this is done. In particular, the metrics applied to compare rules as to "difficulty for Machine Learning Algorithms" are ordinal, which supports the application of the Mann-Whitney test, to decide whether two rules are significantly different in difficulty. A typical point statistic for that analysis is the median value of the cumulated error curve, at whatever point is chosen for comparison. For ML, this number, E*, is well defined even if the learning curve is not flattening, and shows no signs that learning occurs. </p> 

<p> For human learning (HL) there are two "natural" ratio scale metrics: M*, the median value of the "aha move" <i> for those subjects who did discover the rule </i> and F*, the fraction of all subjects who did discover the rule. For visual comparison with the E* value these two metrics are combined into a single measure that increases with increasing difficulty. In the graphic shown here the scale value, V, is computed as M*/F*. This increases with M*, and increases with decreasing F*
