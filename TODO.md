Can we use two tilde's around ~~strikethrough~~ when something moves from one stage to another?
# Ideas
  - compute the difficulty of a rule from the EV score *PK*    
  - compute transfer among rules, using change in difficulty *PK*    
  - compute similarity of rules by transfer effect on difficulty *PK*
  - about a web interface for those processes: DETAILS:  PK2> You are correct.  I am still puzzling over whether there is some way to define difficulty that will remain correct if we change the set of rules being examined.  I fear that it may not be possible at all. I agree that this analysis has to be presented with a "WARNING: the discussion here is conditioned on the specific set of rules and conditions being examined,  and should not be interpreted as an 'absolute' measure of difficulty or transfer effect."  Perhaps you can add that to the web report, in red ink. *PK*
- in the "egg in my beer category" - it would be great if the analysis leading to the ecdf curves, based on not only what has been "seen" but on whether it has been solved, could be accessed by a dumb web user. This process has so many options, and produces so much output, that I am not even sure how to specify it.  For example, the graph(s) may become very cluttered, and the legend, similarly, would need to be extracted   to correspond to whichever graph is displayed. *PK*
- It's OK to briefly prioritize this computation of "conditional on what is examined, the transfer effect", but the **Gemini access** is more important because it is needed in order for Lazaros to be able to really explore that "unfunded initiative.
